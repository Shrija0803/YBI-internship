#YBI Internship – Data Analysis Projects using Python (Google Colab)

This repository contains data analysis and machine learning projects completed during the YBI Foundation Internship using Python in Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook).

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Projects Included:

1️)Ice Cream Revenue Prediction using Linear Regression
This project analyzes the relationship between temperature and ice cream revenue.  
A Linear Regression model is used to predict revenue based on temperature.

2)Admission Chance Prediction using Linear Regression
This project predicts the probability of a student getting admission based on academic and profile parameters. 
A Linear Regression model is used to estimate the Chance of Admit from various input features.

Steps performed:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation using R² score
- Visualization of regression line

How to Run the Project:
Open the notebook in Google Colab using the GitHub link and run all cells to view outputs.
